Heyo, this is MyStackOverflows aka i_4m_h4ck3rm4n aka Paul.
I code in C#, Java, and Python. I'm fairly proficient with both Windows and Linux operating systems, as well as the commandlines of each. I'm also familiar with several scripting languages.
Currently a first-year computer science student, but I've been coding since I was 12 courtesy of Python and a Raspberry Pi 2. Interested in video games, game design, artificial intelligence, computer hardware, and more.
