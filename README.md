Heyo, this is MyStackOverflows aka i_4m_h4ck3rm4n aka Paul.
I code in C#, Java, and Python, with a small amount of experience with C, C++, and SQL. I'm fairly proficient with both Windows and Linux operating systems, as well as the commandlines of each. I'm also somewhat familiar with several scripting languages (Bash, Batch). I build gaming computers for my friends and have worked at a computer repair shop diagnosing and repairing computer systems.
Currently a third-year computer science student, but I've been coding since I was 12 courtesy of Python and a Raspberry Pi 2. Interested in video games, game design, artificial intelligence, computer hardware, and more.
