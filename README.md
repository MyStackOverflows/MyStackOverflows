Heyo, this is MyStackOverflows aka Paul Unger.
I code in C#, Java, and Python, with some experience with C, C++, JS, and SQL. I'm proficient with both Windows and Linux operating systems, as well as the commandlines of each - Linux CLI especially, due to me running my own headless Ubuntu server for personal projects. I build gaming computers for my friends and have worked at a computer repair shop diagnosing and repairing computer systems.
Currently a fourth-year computer science student, but I've been coding since I was 12 courtesy of Python and a Raspberry Pi 2. Interested in video games, game design, artificial intelligence, computer hardware, and more.
